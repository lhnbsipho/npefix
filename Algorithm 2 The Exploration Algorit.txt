 Algorithm 2 The Exploration Algorithm of NPEfix
 Input: p: a program
 Input: t: a test case reproducing a NPE
 Input: S: a set of repair strategies
 Output: P: set of tentative patches
 Output: Q: set of valid patches
 1: Mp create meta-program of p
 2: compile Mp
 3: execute t against Mp until null dereference
 4: D collects all possible metaprogramming patches
 based on runtime analysis
 5: terminate execution
 6: for d in D do

 13:
 activate d in metaprogram
 execute t against Mp
 p patch corresponding to d
 add p to P
 if t succeeds then
 add p to Q
 end if
 14: end for
